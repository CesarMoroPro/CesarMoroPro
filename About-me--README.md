- 👋 Hi, I'm César and I arrived in the web development world during the year 2020. 
- 👀 In my life, I’m interested in web development of course, but also in sports. For now, I run, but I want to run a triathlon in the futur. I want to get the freefall licence too, and I want to swim with sharks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning or re-learning Sass, JavaScript, PHP, and some frameworks like VueJs for example. I love this idea that in this job, we can always learn something. We can't be bored when we are a web developer.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to a special collaborate. Just want to learn well my new job. For the moment, I sometimes (often ?) need help, but I want to be able to help someone next.
- 📫 How to reach me : cesar.moro.dev@gmail.com.
